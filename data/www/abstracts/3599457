Improving_NN text_NN collection_NN selection_NN with_IN coverage_NN and_CC overlap_VB statistics_NNS
In_IN an_DT environment_NN of_IN distributed_VBN text_NN collections_NNS ,_, the_DT first_JJ step_NN in_IN the_DT information_NN retrieval_NN process_NN is_VBZ to_TO identify_VB which_WDT of_IN all_DT available_JJ collections_NNS are_VBP more_RBR relevant_JJ to_TO a_DT given_VBN query_NN and_CC which_WDT should_MD thus_RB be_VB accessed_VBN to_TO answer_VB the_DT query_NN ._.
We_PRP address_VBP the_DT challenge_NN of_IN collection_NN selection_NN when_WRB there_EX is_VBZ full_JJ or_CC partial_JJ overlap_VBP between_IN the_DT available_JJ text_NN collections_NNS ,_, a_DT scenario_NN which_WDT has_VBZ not_RB been_VBN examined_VBN previously_RB despite_IN its_PRP$ real-world_JJ applications_NNS ._.
To_TO that_DT end_NN ,_, we_PRP present_VBP COSCO_NNP ,_, a_DT collection_NN selection_NN approach_NN which_WDT uses_VBZ collection-specific_JJ coverage_NN and_CC overlap_VB statistics_NNS ._.
We_PRP describe_VBP our_PRP$ experimental_JJ results_NNS which_WDT show_VBP that_IN the_DT presented_VBN approach_NN displays_VBZ the_DT desired_VBN behavior_NN of_IN retrieving_VBG more_JJR new_JJ results_NNS early_RB on_IN in_IN the_DT collection_NN order_NN ,_, and_CC performs_VBZ consistently_RB and_CC significantly_RB better_JJR than_IN CORI_NNP ,_, previously_RB considered_VBN to_TO be_VB one_CD of_IN the_DT best_JJS collection_NN selection_NN systems_NNS ._.
